Different scientific settings require different organization of data. We would like to provide a spectrum of schemas in our [gallery](/gallery/) to give new users an easier start. If you think you have a cool schema and you would like to share it, we are happy to host it here. 

If you want to contribute, please follow these instructions

* Fork this page on [github](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint.github.io).
* Clone your fork to your local computer. The website is produced with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). However, you don't need jekyll to add a schema. You just need it if you want to render the website locally. 
* Add another post with the tag 'schema' to `_posts` (just look at other examples). Also, add the language (matlab/python) in the tags of the post and don't forget to specify yourself as the author of the schema. All posts filenames must have the format `yyyy-mm-dd-postname.md`. It is probably a good idea to put the word `schema` somewhere in the postname. Posts are written in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The best is probably to use another schema post as template. 
* If you want to upload additional files (e.g. the Matlab/Python files or images), please put them in the `public` folder (or a reasonable subfolder of it). 
* Add new files to the git repository, commit, and push to **your** fork of the website. 
* Go to **your** fork of the website on github and send us a pull request. Once we accepted it, your changes will be on the official website.
