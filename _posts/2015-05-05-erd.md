The entity relation ship diagram displays the tables in the schema and the foreign key dependencies between them. To view the entity relationship diagram of the entire DataJoint schema called `<package>`, type

```
>> erd <package>
```

To view the diagram of the immediate neighborhood of a single [base relvar](base relvars), type
```
>> erd <package>.<ClassName>
```
Since the ERD is a directed acyclic graph, all dependencies point upward and arrowheads are omitted. The font color indicates the tier of each table (<font color=gray>lookup</font>, <font color=green>manual</font>, <font color=blue>imported</font>, and <font color=red>computed</font>). And the asterisk * indicates a subtable. Solid edges indicate [[hierarchical dependencies]] and dashed edges indicate [[non-hierarchical dependencies]].
