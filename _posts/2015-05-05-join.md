The [natural join](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra#Natural_join_.28.E2.8B.88.29) operator between two relvars is implemented using the times operator `*`.

```
A*B
```
contains all fields in both `A` and `B`. The tuples of `A*B` contain the Cartesian product (all possible pairs) of tuples in `A` and `B` but keeps only those that match. Matching tuples are those in which identically named attributes have equal values.

In DataJoint schemas, primary key attributes of related tables share attribute names. Thus in most cases, joins are performed on primary keys. 

A powerful way to control the result of the join operator is by renaming the attributes of one or both arguments.

Any attribute that is in the primary key of either `A` or `B` is included in the primary key of `A*B`.

For example
```
cells = tp.Cells * common.Session
```
creates the relation `cells` with the attributes of both `common.Session` and `tp.Cells` in matching tuples.
