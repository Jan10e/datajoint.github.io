{"name":"DataJoint","tagline":"High-level relational database interface for MATLAB","body":"### Welcome to DataJoint\r\nDataJoint for MATLAB is a high-level programming interface for relational databases designed to support data processing chains in science labs. DataJoint is built on the foundation of the relational data model and prescribes a consistent method for organizing, populating, and querying data.\r\n\r\nDataJoint primarily targets MATLAB but a Python interface is currently in development. MySQL is used as the backend for data storage.\r\n\r\n### Get started\r\n1. Clone the [DataJoint for MATLAB](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-matlab) repository\r\n2. Download [our fork of mym](https://github.com/datajoint/mym), the MySQL connector for MATLAB, originally developed by [Yannick Maret](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mym/)\r\n3. Follow [our tutorial](https://github.com/datajoint/example)\r\n\r\n### Who are we?\r\nDataJoint was initially developed in 2009 by Dimitri Yatsenko in [Andreas Tolias' Lab](http://toliaslab.org) for the distributed processing and management of large volumes of data streaming from regular experiments. Starting in 2011, DataJoint has been available as an open-source project adopted by other labs and improved through contributions from several developers.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
